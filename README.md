# human-cli
A reflective journal CLI for your next side project
How? Your terminal asks you questions about your life and slowly builds an emotional log in your repo that you and others can look back on!

## Manifesto
Coding is done by humans who live complex livevs embedded in a complex and everchanging world.   

The ideas we have that end up in code are not built in a vacuum but rather are responses to our daily emotions and reactions to the global temperature.  

Engineers are thought to be logical, rational, and emotionless. And the tools created for them, often reflect that sterotype.   

This project imagines a world in which reflection, critical thought and connection to the your emotions all become a part of the development workflow.   


## What is it?
Gist is a command line interface that replaces your usual git commit message. 

Along with commiting your code update to your repo, it prompts you with a question about your current life state like:
```
What's one problem you are interested to solve that you are not thinking about enough right now?
```

gist creates a time capsule of these emotional memories throughout your personal project, giving it a sense of context-awareness. 
At the end, you and any collaborators will be able ot trace the rollercoaster of creating your tool through the CAPSULE.md file.   
[Here's an example](CAPSULE.md)
